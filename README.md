I'm an undergraduate at **Northwestern University**, studying **Computer Science** and the **Integrated Science Program**. My work focuses on **low-level systems**, **programming language infrastructure**, and **scientific computing**.

---

## ⚙️ Interests

- **Systems Programming** — building efficient, predictable software with careful attention to memory, performance, and concurrency
- **Programming Languages** — designing tools and DSLs that emphasize type safety, correctness, and expressive abstraction
- **Scientific Infrastructure** — writing code to drive robust, accurate, and maintainable computation-driven research
- **Runtime and Compilation Models** — exploring interpreters, emulators, schema compilers, and transformation pipelines

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### Gameboy Emulator (C++26)
A full CPU emulator with cycle-accurate memory and I/O modeling. Built using modern C++ features for type-safe dispatch and modular architecture. Focused on architectural fidelity and performance.

### OCaml Static Content DSL
A statically typed compiler that transforms structured data schemas into TypeScript modules. Leverages algebraic data types and exhaustive pattern matching to eliminate runtime errors and ensure downstream consistency.

### Distributed Job Aggregation Pipeline
Concurrent job processing system using gRPC and message queues to collect and transform live data streams. Implements backpressure, fault tolerance, and durable persistence.
